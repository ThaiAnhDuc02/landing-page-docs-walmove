# Cloud Architecture

At the initial stages of the project, our system successfully established a shared networking system on AWS Cloud. At this point, our infrastructure was entirely cloud-focused, effectively operating in a "simulated" manner. Despite the simulation nature of the system, it was able to produce results that aligned with our expectations and predictions.

The architecture of **Walnut** comprises a private network on the cloud, which includes the **Walnut** Server, responsible for the system's operations, and an application layer that allows end-users to access services provided by **Walnut**.

Thus, the architecture of **Walnut** is divided into two main parts:

## Application

Users interact directly with **Walnut** through a web interface that is clear, concise, and easy to use. This application communicates with **Walnut**'s underlying system to perform a variety of features designed to serve end-users.

## Backend

**Walnut**'s servers are hosted on the cloud to extend server reach and enhance the user experience when using **Walnut**'s services. **Walnut** is responsible for creating **Header Nodes** and **Worker Nodes**, as well as terminating **Worker Nodes** when they remain unused for extended periods.

  In hybrid infrastructure, Worker Nodes represent the user's personal computers
  rather than virtual machines in the Cloud.
</Callout>

When a user registers a worker node, represented as a virtual machine, into the system, **Walnut** will request AWS to create a virtual machine and establish communication with it.

When another end-user wants to deploy a cluster to perform a specific task, **Walnut** will check the availability of worker nodes to create a suitable cluster for the user's needs.

Only **Walnut** can communicate with the Header and Worker Nodes, and the nodes on the cloud can also communicate with each other. End-users cannot access the **Header Nodes** or **Worker Nodes** directly.
