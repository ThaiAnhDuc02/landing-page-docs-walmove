# Submit Task

This guide explains how to submit a heavy task to Walnut Cloud for processing, which can involve both CPU and GPU resources.

## Overview

When you handle a heavy and time-consuming task, such as training an AI model, you can submit this task to Walnut Cloud to be processed by data providers and GPU providers. The header node will distribute the tasks to the worker nodes for efficient processing.

In the future, we plan to enable direct task submission from environments like Jupyter and VSCode.

## Key Features

### Distributed Computing
- Automatic task distribution across multiple worker nodes
- Efficient resource allocation based on task requirements
- Real-time monitoring of task progress
- Automatic error handling and task recovery

### Resource Management
- Dynamic scaling of computing resources
- Support for both CPU and GPU intensive tasks
- Optimized resource utilization
- Cost-effective processing for large-scale computations

### Security
- End-to-end encryption of submitted code and data
- Secure communication between nodes
- Access control and authentication
- Data privacy protection

## Submission Process

<Steps>
### Access Submit Task

Begin by selecting **Submit Task** from the menu to access the submission interface.

### Example Implementation

Here's an example of a distributed computing task calculating Pi using the Nilakantha series algorithm:

```python showLineNumbers
def calculate_pi_nilakantha(iterations):
    pi = 3.0
    sign = 1
    for i in range(2, 2 + 2 * iterations, 2):
        pi += sign * (4 / (i * (i + 1) * (i + 2)))
        sign *= -1  # Toggle sign after each iteration
    return pi

# Example usage of the function with 1 million iterations
iterations = 1000000
pi_estimate = calculate_pi_nilakantha(iterations)
```
